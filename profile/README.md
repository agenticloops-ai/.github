# Agentic Loops

**Engineering-first. Production-grade. No magic.**

Design patterns, system architecture, and production-grade implementations for software engineers building autonomous AI systems.

---

Building AI agents is engineering, not magic. LLM-powered systems are non-deterministic and fragile — they demand proper software engineering, not prompt-hacking or black-box approaches.

We focus on first principles: what LLMs can and cannot do, where their boundaries are, and how to make the right trade-offs between autonomy and control, flexibility and predictability, speed and safety.

### What We Believe

- **First Principles Over Frameworks** — Frameworks come and go, but LLM constraints don't. Master the constraints, not the hype.
- **Design for Non-Determinism** — Traditional software gives guarantees; LLMs don't. Architect for uncertainty.
- **Master the Trade-offs** — Autonomy vs. control. Flexibility vs. predictability. Speed vs. safety.
- **Learn by Building** — Reference implementations, battle-tested patterns, first-principles thinking.
